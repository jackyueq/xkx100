TMI-2 (tmi.ccs.neu.edu 5555) has released its mudlib.  The Nightmare
(nightmare.imaginary.com 1701) mudlib is also available, as well as the
Discworld mudlib, which runs with minor modifications to the driver.  The
Foundation mudlib is also available for those who want more to work with than
testsuite but less than a full-fledged mudlib.  

If you have developed a MudOS mudlib that is publically available, please
send email to mudos-bugs@actlab.rtf.utexas.edu letting us know where to
obtain it (so that we may include a reference to it in a future release
of MudOS).
 
TMI-2 is available via anonymous ftp (login as ftp) from
ftp.ccs.neu.edu:/pub/mud/mudlibs.
 
All the mudlibs mentioned above are available via anonymous ftp from
ftp.imaginary.com.
